# Osheet

CLI application for browsing spreadsheets


## Known bugs

- Currently sizes display for the screen I use to develop on
- When passing the cursor outside the boundarides, crash
- Overflowing text highlights the trailing coloum separator


## Features to add

- Space on overflowing cell to show entire cell contents
- Scroll
- Resize columns
- Search


## Other applications to view spreadsheets on CLI

- [SC-IM](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im): I would actually be using this if it supported arbitrary text search.
